	<h2> About Us</h2>
	
	<h3>About the Author: Cris Lindsey</h3>
	<p>Cris Lindsey was born in Wadesboro, NC., son of Evelyn and Kenneth Lindsey. His father was in the U.S. Navy,
			whn he met Cris's mother. Like father like sons, with the exception of one, Cris has four brothers whom
			are all in the U.S. Navy. Cris's experience in education began with him teaching in Madrid, Spain at the Hill House
			Montessori Schools. His concept for writing children books came from his desire for his daughter to be able to read
			at an early age. He began his concept when his daughter was only three years of age, and he had created his first book
			"See I Can Read", at the end of 1999.
	</p>
	<p>Cris began selling his books at a kiosk in Chesapeake Square Mall in Chesapeake, VA where he sold copies of Volume 1.
			For the next six years to follow, parents were asking Cris for more of the books. In 2005, Cris went to work for one year
			in New Orelans following the aftermath of Hurricane katrina. When he returned to Virgina he began working, finalizing
			his five volume series for mass production. Working together with Wilheimina Long, creative/graphic designer, and a 
			book printing company, the books were prepared in hard back and ready for the public. "See I Can Read" books can
			be purchased in the Borders Book Store in Virginia Beach, VA; Busy Bee Children Clothing and Accessory Store in Hill Top,
			Virginia Beach, VA; Prince Books in Norfolk, VA; Lawrence Pharmacy in Chesapeake, VA; A & B Books in Texas, as well as
			through purchasing online.
	</p>
	<p> It is Cris's hopes and dreams to see his books in children's hands around the world, inspiring a passion in children to read,
			teaching them to be good readers and explore the world through books. From the sales of his books, Cris will donate a portion
			of the proceeds to non-profit organizations that service children. It is also Cris's goal to raise enough money to start an organization
			to help single parents trying to raise their children by themselves -- he feels the children should not have to suffer because of lack of 
			needs to provide for them. Save the children and give them a fighting chance. Give a child a book.
	</p>

	<h3>History and Credits</h3>
	<p>SEE I CAN READ children's books are designed to teach 3 to 6 year olds to read by themselves.
			The concept was conceived as Cris Lindsey, President of Millennium 2000 Publishing Company,
			was working with his daughter Sarah. He wanted her to be able to read her own mail when he wrote to her.
			He created the books to give his daughter as well as other children a sense of independence.
			The books were created using picture illustrations to form the sentences, with the actual words written under
			the pictures so that the child can recognize the pictures and associate it with the word beneath it.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Case Studies</h3>
	<p>This method has proven itself very effective with young children. Once they realize that they can read,
			by following the picture illustration, they become so excited and their desire to read becomes even greater.
			Now the child can read like big brother or big sister, like mommy and daddy, which makes that little child feel
			important and not excluded. Now the child can pick up his or her book, and proceed to read to mommy, daddy,
			big brother, or big sister. The child feels good about himself, and confident. This confidence generally carries on
			to other task they soon encounter in their everyday adventures in life. It gives the children the desire to excel in
			all they attempt to do in their struggle to seek out their independence.

			hearing the story, the child will pickup his or her favorite book and pretend to read the book to you by reciting from memory.
	</p>
	
	<p>No longer do they have to pretend, thanks to Millennium 2000 Publishing Company's new book series that structures the picture illustration
			in a sentece format. The by placing the actual words under the pictures the child can see that the word sentence is and the word text, their boost
			of confidence is increased along with their desire to learn to read.
